# terraformgames
This is a sample demo just to reach the target goals of the task (create Terraform definition to run a Dockerized service inside Azure Container Apps, protected by Azure Application Gateway WAF). 
So there are no modules which can be re-used, because there is no need of them so far (eg https://github.com/antonbabenko/terraform-best-practices/tree/master/examples/small-terraform).
Also, varaible list can be extended but I suppose it's enough for this demo.
